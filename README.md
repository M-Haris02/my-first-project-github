# My First GitHub Project

This is a simple Python application created as part of my GitHub learning assignment.

## Exciting New Feature
This section introduces a new conceptual "feature" for the project, demonstrating a feature branch workflow.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates basic Python functionality and a standard GitHub workflow, including:
- Repository creation
- Initial commit
- Branching
- Merging
- Pull Requests

The `simple_app.py` script asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting message.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository (you've already done this!):
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/M-Haris02/my-first-project-github.git](https://github.com/M-Haris02/my-first-project-github.git)
   ```
3. Navigate into the project directory (you're already here!):
   ```bash
   cd my-first-project-github
   ```
4. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python simple_app.py
   ```
